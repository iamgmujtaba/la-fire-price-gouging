""He lives out of state and this ocean front unit is his vacation home that he and his family enjoy frequently.  I believe that from time to time, he would rent it for shorter, defined periods of time that would allow him to still use it when he wanted to. $9,000 (a reduced rent according to the comps) simply allowed him the flexibility to rent short terms within timeframes that worked for him and his family so they could still enjoy their asset. I was not involved in those leases and I’m not even sure if he did actually lease it out or how many times he did.   

Until these horrific wildfires, he never considered renting it for a long duration. Given the current events, he wants to help a family and is willing to forgo his beloved vacation home for a long term lease, furnished with his personal belongings - all while leaving him without an opportunity to use it himself.  

For this, he is simply asking a market rent price that JUST covers his expenses, without considering the fact that it is furnished. He is making no profit it this endeavor.  I ran the comps and market price for a furnished, ocean view unit with 2 parking spaces in prime Marina Del Rey could easily extend past the fair price he is asking.""

SO...if he would normally rent it for short periods for $9K, why is this $12.5K what he needs to ask now ""to cover his expenses?"" F this guy and the broker who is helping him."

The agent responded to our agent saying that ""multiple people wanted the property"" and that the landlord gave her a response saying that ""he is likely putting the property on airbnb"" so he could list for ""$16,000 a month for a 2-month rental or $14,000 for 3-months.""

The mold has now been remediated and yesterday we received a notification taped to our door of a rent increase far above the 10% allowable by law. I have always had roommates to share in cost of rent and now landlord is saying I am unable to sublet the rooms in the house which I believe is retaliatory and illegal."

I decided to schedule a tour on Wednesday (01/08/2025), because it was newly renovated, had a washer and dryer in-unit, and the price was within my budget, $2,495. On Sunday (01/12/25), I checked the listing, to prepare for the tour, and noticed the price increased. On Monday (01/13/24), I met with Yonathan Tefera to tour the apartment. I asked him why the price had increased and if is set or if the previous price could be upheld. He stated that it was because of the renovations and new appliances, and it is a great price for what is being offered. However, when I first looked at the apartment, the description mentioned the renovations. Maybe I don’t understand how pricing works when renovations are being done, but as a renter, I was under the impression those renovations were already completed at the time it was priced at $2,495. I did not clarify whether there was anything done over the weekend but the pictures on Zillow do not have anything different from what I saw when I toured. I have videos of the property, if needed.
The building is small, with a maximum of around 5-6 units. Yonathan shared that the previous resident lived in the unit I was touring for, I believe, 10+ years."

Altadena fire refugees toured on 1/11 and were asked to pay for the pool service and the gardener, adding several hundred dollars to the monthly rent. The agent didn’t even know how much either would be. A family that lost everything in the Eaton fire was asked to provide their own washer, dryer, AND fridge. Property was filthy and in disrepair."
